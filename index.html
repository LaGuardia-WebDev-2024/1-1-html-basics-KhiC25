<h1>  Not A Love Poem  </h1>
  
  <p>
    Roses are red, Violets are blue<br>
    <em>I dont know where I'd be, if I never met you</em><br>
    When you look into my eyes, I can't help but <strong>FREEZE</strong><br>
    On nights when I dream, I imagine dropping to my knees<br>
    Asking you, <em>will you be my bride to be?</em>
  </p>
